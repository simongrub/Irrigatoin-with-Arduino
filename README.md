# Irrigatoin-with-Arduino
This small project is to make an automatic irrigation System and to store the Data in an Array that can get bigger if needed.
## How it works
The moisture sensor is inserted into the soil and continuously measures the moisture content in the soil.
              The Arduino reads the data and compares it to a predefined threshold.
              If the data is below the threshold, the water pump is activated.
              At the same time, the data is read into a dynamic array so that it can be read out later with the push of a button.
              The watering process continues until the moisture content is back above the threshold.
